üîê Authentication & Security
<!-- 
Stop trusting localStorage for auth: It‚Äôs fine for your current app, but for production move to:

Sessions (express-session) or

JWT tokens (with cookies/headers). -->

Password hashing: Never store raw passwords. Use bcrypt or argon2.

Validation & sanitization: Use libraries like express-validator to validate inputs (e.g. check email format, enforce password rules).

Rate limiting: Prevent brute force login attempts with express-rate-limit.

CORS & HTTPS: If deployed, make sure CORS is configured correctly and always use HTTPS.

üóÑÔ∏è Database Practices

Schema design: Make sure your Todo schema references the user correctly (userId: { type: ObjectId, ref: 'User' }).

Indexes: Add indexes on frequently queried fields like userId for faster lookups.

Validation at DB level: Enforce required fields, unique username/email, etc.

Transactions: If you ever add multi-step actions (e.g. create user + create default todos), learn how to use MongoDB transactions.

‚ö° Backend Code Quality

Error handling middleware: One centralized error handler in Express.

Async/await wrappers: Use a utility to avoid writing try/catch everywhere.

HTTP status codes: Always send meaningful codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500).

Logging: Use something like morgan for request logs + winston/pino for error logs.

Environment variables: Store DB credentials, JWT secret, etc. in .env files (not in code).

üé® Frontend UX

Proper error messages: Show friendly errors when login fails, task fails to save, etc.

Loading states: Show spinners while waiting for data.

Validation on forms: Don‚Äôt let empty username/password fields even hit the server.

Persistent sessions: Skip login if the token/session is valid.

üöÄ Deployment Readiness

Build scripts: Have npm run start and npm run dev scripts set up.

Static assets: Serve frontend efficiently (maybe bundle with Webpack/Vite later).

Reverse proxy: Learn to deploy with Nginx or a PaaS (Heroku, Render, Railway).

Database in cloud: Use MongoDB Atlas or another managed DB service.

Scaling: Know basics of horizontal scaling (though not urgent for a todo app).
